# PortalGems - Architecture Reference

The single document to read before building new features. Everything here was
verified working as of 2026-07-11 (phases 0–4 complete). Per-phase discovery
notes live in the other `docs/*.md` files; this is the consolidated map.

## 1. The engine - `native/wormhole-core`

Rust crate over `magic-wormhole` 0.8 (EUPL-1.2; app is GPL-3.0-or-later via
the compatibility clause). Public API (all take a `cancel` future that races
the ENTIRE pipeline - a waiting sender blocks inside `Wormhole::connect`, so
cancel must cover more than the transfer phase):

- `send_file(path, code: Option<&str>, on_code, on_transit, progress, cancel)`
  - `code: None` allocates a fresh 2-word code; `Some(code)` claims that exact
  code (`MailboxConnection::connect(..., allocate=true)`) - the pairing
  primitive.
- `request_receive(code, cancel) -> PendingReceive { file_name, file_size }`
  - connects and waits for the offer WITHOUT accepting: powers confirmation
  UIs. `PendingReceive::accept(dest_dir, ...) -> PathBuf` (never clobbers:
  `name (1).ext` suffixes) / `::reject()`.
- `receive_file(...)` = request + auto-accept (used by pairing handshake).
- `create_test_file(dir, size_kb)` - dev/test helper.
- File names from the network are sanitized (`sanitize_file_name` strips path
  components; empty/dot names → `received.bin`).
- Errors: one flat `Error` enum (`InvalidCode`, `Cancelled`, `AlreadyConsumed`,
  wrapped wormhole/transfer/IO). Foreign sides receive the Display string;
  `packages/core/src/errors.ts::friendlyError` pattern-matches it to
  localized messages. If you add error cases, extend BOTH.
- Wire-compatible with every magic-wormhole client (CLI, Warp, Destiny…) on the
  SAME servers. Every entry point takes a `ServerConfig { rendezvous_url,
  transit_url }` (uniffi Record / napi object); empty fields fall back to the
  community defaults. `app_config()` clones `APP_CONFIG` and overrides only the
  rendezvous URL - the app id stays fixed, so interop is preserved. Bad URLs
  surface as `Error::InvalidServerUrl` (mapped in `errors.ts`). The picker model
  + resolver live in `packages/core/src/servers.ts`; each app persists the
  choice (mobile `setSetting('pg-server')`, desktop localStorage `pg-server`)
  and passes the resolved config on every send/receive/pair call.
- **`wss://` (TLS) support is NOT default.** magic-wormhole's own `tls` feature
  maps to `async-tungstenite/async-tls`, which has no smol-runtime integration in
  0.34 and fails to compile; `native-tls` would drag in OpenSSL (painful for
  Android). So `Cargo.toml` instead enables rustls on the shared async-tungstenite
  (`async-tungstenite` with `futures-rustls-webpki-roots`) plus `rustls` with the
  `ring` provider, and `lib.rs::ensure_crypto_provider()` installs ring once at
  each entry point (rustls 0.23 panics without a provider). rustls+ring
  cross-compiles cleanly to all Android ABIs and trusts Let's Encrypt via bundled
  webpki roots. Without this, only cleartext `ws://` works and TLS servers fail
  with "rendezvous server connection". Verified E2E against a real `wss://` server
  (desktop + mobile, incl. transit-relay fallback).

Tests: `cargo test` (unit) · `cargo test -- --ignored` (network round-trip).

## 2. Binding layers

### Android - `packages/wormhole-rn` (uniffi-bindgen-react-native 0.31)

- `native/wormhole-core/src/ffi.rs` holds the UniFFI surface: async
  `send_file`/`receive_file`/`request_receive`, object `IncomingFile`
  (`fileName()/fileSize()/accept()/reject()`), callback trait
  `TransferListener { on_code, on_transit, on_progress }`.
- TS signatures generated in `src/generated/wormhole_core.ts`: u64 → `bigint`,
  async fns take `{ signal: AbortSignal }` (abort = drop the Rust future =
  cancellation; this is how mobile cancel works).
- **Pure C++ turbo-module** (RN ≥ 0.77 style): no Kotlin/Gradle in the library;
  the app builds `android/CMakeLists.txt` directly. ubrn re-emits its old
  Kotlin flavor on every `--and-generate` - `scripts/ubrn-postgen.sh` (chained
  in `yarn ubrn:android[:release]`) deletes it and restores our CMakeLists.
- After regenerating: `yarn prepare` (bob rebuilds `lib/`, which is what apps
  resolve) and restart Metro with `--reset-cache`.
- jniLibs (`.a` per ABI) are build outputs (gitignored); `android/generated`
  (RN codegen) IS committed (`codegenConfig.includesGeneratedCode: true`).

### Desktop - `native/wormhole-node` (napi-rs 2)

- Electron's V8 memory cage forbids external ArrayBuffers → ubrn's `@ubjs/node`
  is unusable here; this addon crosses the FFI with strings/f64 only.
- **Id-registry model** (avoids napi async-method-on-class lifetime issues):
  renderer allocates an id; `sendFile(id, …)`, `requestReceive(id, code) →
  {fileName, fileSize}`, `acceptReceive(id, destDir)`, `rejectReceive(id)`,
  `cancelTransfer(id)` (tokio oneshot → engine cancel future).
- Loaded in the Electron **main** process (`src/engine.ts`); renderer talks
  via IPC (`pg:*` handlers in `src/main.ts`, exposed by `src/preload.ts`,
  events streamed on `pg:event {id, event, ...}`).

## 3. Shared logic - `packages/core`

Consumed by both apps as **npm `file:` symlinks** (see §5 build gotchas).

- `tokens.ts` - 5 gem themes (`THEME_NAMES`) × light/dark `Palette`, spacing/
  radius/fontSize scales. UI components take colors from the active palette
  only - never hardcode.
- `i18n/` - en/de/bs/ru/fr/es JSON + `initI18n(locale)`, `setLanguage`,
  `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`. **Every user-visible string goes in en.json first,
  then ALL five translations** - `vitest` fails if key sets or `{{placeholders}}`
  diverge (i18n.test.ts).
- `pairing.ts` - THE protocol-critical file. Payload
  `PGPAIR1:<b64url(json{v,name,secret})>` (32-byte secret); code derivation
  `HMAC-SHA256(secret, "portalgems-code-v1:"+bucket)` → 8-digit nameplate +
  2×10 hex; bucket = unixSeconds/300, receiver tries `[b, b−1, b+1]`.
  Timeouts: sender 45 s, receiver poll 60 s. A frozen test vector pins the
  derivation - **changing it breaks pairing between app versions**. Own UTF-8
  codec (Hermes has no TextDecoder). Crypto via @noble/hashes (pure JS).
- `errors.ts` - engine-string → i18n-key mapping.

Tests: `cd packages/core && npm test` (vitest, 25 tests).

## 4. The apps

Both implement the same flows/routes: home (devices + send + receive), send
(paired or code), receive (request → confirm → accept), pair (show QR /
scan / paste), settings (language + theme, persisted), explainer.

### Mobile - `packages/app-mobile` (`com.gemstech.portalgems`)

- Kotlin support module `PortalGemsNative` (registered manually in
  MainApplication): SAF `copyToCache(uri)` (Rust can't read `content://`),
  MediaStore `saveToDownloads` (API 29+ insert + legacy fallback, dedup name
  queried back), foreground `TransferService` (dataSync, held only during
  transfers), `consumePendingShare` (ACTION_SEND intake, polled on mount +
  AppState active), EncryptedSharedPreferences pair store, zxing-embedded
  `scanQr()`, plain SharedPreferences `get/setSetting`, constants
  (`incomingDir`, `cacheDir`, `deviceName`, `locale`).
- Receive path: engine → app cache → MediaStore publish → visible in Downloads.
- Release signing: `android/keystore.properties` + keystore (gitignored;
  falls back to debug key when absent). ABIs: arm64-v8a + x86_64 (add armv7
  before store release).

### Desktop - `packages/app-desktop`

- React DOM renderer (deliberate pivot from the react-native-web plan - shared
  *brains* in core, thin per-platform UIs), esbuild-bundled
  (`NODE_PATH=./node_modules` for the symlinked core's deps).
- Pairing storage: `safeStorage`-encrypted file in userData. Settings:
  localStorage. Device name: hostname. Receives into `~/Downloads`.
- Smoke harness (dev-only, env-guarded in main.ts): `PG_SMOKE_RECEIVE=<code>`,
  `PG_SMOKE_RECEIVE_CANCEL=<code>`, `PG_SMOKE_PAIR_SHOW=1`,
  `PG_SMOKE_PAIRED_RECEIVE=1`, `PG_SMOKE_PAIRED_SEND=<file>` - drives the real
  renderer via executeJavaScript; used for all E2E verification.
- Run: `npm run build && npx electron . --no-sandbox`
  (**unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE** - VS Code shells export it).

### Branding / icons

- Canonical logo: `assets/logo.png` (450px, opaque black background);
  `assets/brand-sheet.png` is the full brand exploration sheet. All app icons
  are generated from the logo - regenerate at these sizes if it changes:
- Android: legacy `mipmap-*/ic_launcher{,_round}.png` (48dp base,
  circle-masked), adaptive foreground rasters
  `mipmap-*/ic_launcher_foreground.png` (108dp base, logo at 70% so the ring
  stays inside the 66dp safe zone), background `#000000` in
  `values/colors.xml`, themed-icon vector
  `drawable/ic_launcher_monochrome.xml`.
- Desktop: `packages/app-desktop/build/icon.png` (512px) - electron-builder
  auto-derives all platform formats; also the BrowserWindow icon in `main.ts`.

## 5. Build gotchas (cost hours; read before touching builds)

1. npm `file:` symlinks: Metro needs `watchFolders` + `nodeModulesPaths` +
   `blockList` (wormhole-rn's own react copies!); tsc needs `paths` entries;
   esbuild needs NODE_PATH. New core deps must be installed into BOTH apps.
2. ubrn regeneration re-emits Kotlin-flavor files → always via
   `yarn ubrn:android[:release]` (postgen script), never raw `--and-generate`.
3. @noble/hashes v2 requires `.js` suffixes in subpath imports.
4. Emulator/adb: `adb shell input text` mangles >~20 chars (chunk it);
   MediaStore ownership resets on reinstall; debug↔release signature clash
   needs uninstall.
5. `cargo new` creates nested git repos - check `git status` shows FILES, not
   a bare directory name, after adding a crate.
6. F-Droid discipline: no Google/proprietary deps anywhere (zxing-embedded and
   androidx are fine); toolchains pinned; everything builds from source.
7. **Duplicate-instance bug**: packages/core has its own node_modules (for
   vitest). If a bundler resolves i18next/react-i18next from there, the app
   gets a second instance and every string renders as its raw key. Guards:
   esbuild `--alias:i18next/react-i18next` (desktop build script), metro
   blockList on `core/node_modules` (mobile). Keep both when touching builds.
8. Packaging: **Linux builds locally** - `npm run dist:linux` → AppImage +
   `.deb` + `.rpm` (the `.rpm` target needs the `rpm` tool). **Windows (.exe)
   and macOS (.dmg) are built in CI on native runners**
   (`.github/workflows/release.yml`), NOT cross-compiled: napi-build's
   GNU-Windows path demands a `libnode.dll` you can't get on Linux, so the old
   `dist:win`/mingw route is a dead end (build on the target OS, or let CI do
   it). Desktop bundling is `build:bundles` (esbuild) - it uses `cross-env` for
   `NODE_PATH` so it runs on Windows runners too; each job copies the per-OS
   native addon into `dist/` before electron-builder. `asarUnpack: **/*.node`;
   engine.ts prefers `wormhole_node-<platform>-<arch>.node`, falls back to
   `wormhole_node.node`. The pipeline (create-release → linux/android/desktop
   matrix, each uploading binaries + `.sha256`) fires on any `v*` tag;
   `scripts/package-release.sh` collects local Linux/Android artifacts for
   manual uploads. Android CI needs `cargo-ndk` + the three rustup Android
   targets (arm64, **armv7**, x86_64 - `release.yml` installs them) + keystore
   secrets (`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` etc.).
9. **Stale Metro bundle on incremental Android builds**: `assembleRelease`
   tracks the app's own JS but NOT edits inside the symlinked `@portalgems/core`
   source, so a change there (e.g. a constant in `servers.ts`) can be silently
   left out of the packaged Hermes bundle - the app runs old core code. CI is
   safe (clean checkout); locally, delete `app/build/generated/assets/react` +
   `app/build/intermediates/{assets,merged_assets}/release` before reassembling,
   and verify with `strings <apk>/assets/index.android.bundle | grep <token>`.

## 6. Feature recipes

- **New UI string** → en.json + 5 translations (tests enforce) → use via `t()`.
- **New engine capability** → wormhole-core generic fn (+cancel param) →
  ffi.rs uniffi export → `yarn ubrn:android` + `yarn prepare` →
  wormhole-node napi fn → engine.ts/main.ts/preload.ts IPC → both UIs.
- **New setting** → mobile `get/setSetting` + desktop localStorage; add to
  both settings screens.
- **New screen** → Route union + screen component per app; strings in core.

## 7. Verified-state summary & known gaps

Verified E2E over real servers: manual send/receive (all platform pairs,
checksummed), receive confirmation + decline, share-sheet intake, friendly
errors, cancel (waiting phase, both engines), pairing (desktop↔emulator),
settings (language/theme live-switch, persisted), 6-language completeness.

Packaging is done: all six binaries (APK, AppImage, deb, rpm, Windows .exe,
macOS .dmg) build and publish from a single `v*` tag via CI (first shipped in
v1.0.0/v1.0.1).

Server picker (rendezvous + transit override) verified E2E on the desktop
engine against a locally-run mailbox + transit relay (64 KiB round-trip
checksummed; bad-URL and unreachable-rendezvous error mappings confirmed). The
mobile side needs the ubrn regen + on-device wiring, and `PORTALGEMS_*` in
`servers.ts` are placeholders until the dedicated server is deployed.

Gaps: QR *camera* scan untested (needs real phone) - NOTE: "Show pairing code"
currently crashes on device (react-native-svg suspected, unconfirmed);
mobile server-picker UI + ubrn regen; 32-bit `armeabi-v7a` ABI (older phones
get INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS); paired-transfer UI buttons E2E (smoke
modes exist); mid-transfer cancel; multi-file share; F-Droid recipe; store
metadata.
